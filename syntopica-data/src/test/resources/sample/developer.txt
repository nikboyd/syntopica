There are potentially several kinds of developer. 
A developer generally _**develops**_ (or guides, or manages the development of) software solutions. 
Sometimes their responsibilities (and thus their interests) are combined in a single person or role within an organization. 

| Kind | Interests and _Concerns_ |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| Requirements Engineers | Needs, Usage, Knowledge, Behavior, Quality, Priority |
|  | _Intelligibility, Sufficiency, Coverage, Completeness, Alignment_ |
| Experience Designers | Usage, Knowledge, Behavior, Quality, Priority |
|  | _Intelligibility, Functionality, Usability, Sufficiency, Affordability, Efficiency_ |
| Software Engineers | Usage, Knowledge, Behavior, Quality, Priority |
|  | _Fitness, Simplicity, Flexibility, Adaptability, Modularity, Coverage, Completeness, Compatibility, Measurability, Efficiency_ |
| Quality Engineers | Usage, Knowledge, Behavior, Quality, Priority |
|  | _Sufficiency, Coverage, Completeness, Intelligibility, Alignment_ |
