### Discussion

There are potentially several kinds of [requestors](https://github.com/nikboyd/Syntopica/blob/master/sample-domain/requestor.md).
A [requestor](https://github.com/nikboyd/Syntopica/blob/master/sample-domain/requestor.md) generally oversees and requests [improvements](https://github.com/nikboyd/Syntopica/blob/master/sample-domain/improvement.md) in some [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/Syntopica/blob/master/sample-domain/business.md) [activity](https://github.com/nikboyd/Syntopica/blob/master/sample-domain/activity.md)(s),
or they may have specific domain knowledge and expertise.
They also ensure that the conduct of [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/Syntopica/blob/master/sample-domain/business.md) [activities](https://github.com/nikboyd/Syntopica/blob/master/sample-domain/activity.md) remain in alignment with the purposes of the [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/Syntopica/blob/master/sample-domain/business.md),
esp. with its [mission](https://github.com/nikboyd/Syntopica/blob/master/sample-domain/mission.md) and [vision](https://github.com/nikboyd/Syntopica/blob/master/sample-domain/vision.md).
