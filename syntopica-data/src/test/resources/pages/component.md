### Discussion

A software [solution](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/solution.md) solves some specific (kinds of) problem(s).
Problems typically involve multiple elements from the real world (where they are situated).
Thus, a problem can usually be decomposed into several [component](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/component.md) elements, and these [components](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/component.md)
are often represented in the structure of the software [solution](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/solution.md).<br/><br/>Because software [solutions](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/solution.md) intend to enable or improve the conduct of some [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/business.md) activities,
most software [solutions](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/solution.md) provide some kind of user experience for collecting, manipulating, and
presenting information, whether using a desktop computer, a laptop computer, or a mobile device
(phone, tablet, etc.). Some of the software [components](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/component.md) surface these user experiences through [dialogs](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/dialog.md).
The [dialogs](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/dialog.md) engage users in conversations (of a kind) for collecting, manipulating, and presenting information.
