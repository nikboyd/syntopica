A mission statement can make a difference, especially when properly formulated.
A mission statement should reflect the intended ends of an organization, rather than its means.

* _Ends versus Means._ <br/>An ends statement describes the difference an organization intends to make in the world, rather than merely describing what staff will be doing (the means) to effect those ends.
* _Effects versus Efforts._ <br/>A well-formed ends statement describes the results and effects to be achieved by staff, rather than their efforts and activities. 

Ends are best expressed as effects that are qualitative (valuable) changes in the world. 
Thus, ends are best expressed using adjectives that describe the intended effects, 
i.e., a state (of being) to be achieved. 
Descriptive adjectives especially indicate such states of being.
