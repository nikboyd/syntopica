### Discussion

There are potentially several kinds of [expectors](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/expector.md).
An [expector](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/expector.md) generally expects a software [solution](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/solution.md) to simplify, permit, and improve the conduct of some [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/business.md) [activity](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/activity.md)(s).
In some cases, a [business](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/business.md) [activity](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/activity.md) might not even be allowed, or might not be affordable without a software [solution](https://github.com/nikboyd/SampleDomain/blob/master/solution.md)
to automate some the associated processes, or to monitor them and collect measurements.
