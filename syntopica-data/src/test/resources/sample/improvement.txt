Business activities are most valuable when they are aligned 
with specific and clearly formulated objectives. 
Each business needs to have mission and vision statements that 
focus on the ends the business intends to effect in the world. 
To effect these ends, a business has processes (a series of activities), 
especially processes that operate on information (and so need information systems).
Business information systems are products (with qualities) that provide 
services (which also have qualities). 
Information services support and improve business operations by 
streamlining business processes (which have their own qualities).

An improvement changes the level of some measurable quality 
of a business activity, or it may enable the conduct 
of a business activity that would be difficult, unaffordable, 
or impossible to conduct otherwise. 
So, each business needs to determine its business process 
and improvement objectives. 
Based on these processing and improvement objectives, 
a business needs to specify the product and service 
qualities required of its information systems.

Ideally, the qualities of a software solution and the services 
it provides will be aligned with and supportive of the business 
objectives expressed in the business mission and vision statements. 
So, a business needs to clearly define its objectives (as ends) 
and the means for achieving those objectives 
(especially by using information systems) through the definition 
of measurable changes in the levels of the qualities about which it is most concerned.
