A business accomplishes its mission in the world through its activities. 
And, its activities need to be kept in alignment with its purposes. 
So, the qualities associated with those activities 
warrant measurement in order to manage and improve their conduct.

The activities of a business can be broadly categorized as those 
that are mission critical, mission central, and mission peripheral, 
depending on whether and how the activities are related to 
the overall business mission and vision.
Even though peripheral to its mission, some activities are 
supportive and essential, and thus still required to 
accomplish the business mission.

For example, a business of nearly any size will require some employees, 
and specific regulatory policies will be in place within a legal framework 
for appropriately hiring and firing employees. 
So, while the activities associated with employee management may not 
be considered a mission critical component of the business, 
the associated issues will still require address and may warrant 
some level of automation through some software solution(s).
