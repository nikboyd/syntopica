Syntopica
=========

This project incorporates some ideas about [conceptual models][conceptual-models], 
and offers a prospect for using the [EDUCE patterns][educe-patterns] 
for transforming conceptual models into named software elements.

The **syntopica** library offers a framework for modeling concepts as Facts, 
each of which relates multiple Topics within a [bounded context][bounded-context] (a Domain).

The syntax for expressing Facts are simple statements, like the following:

```
governor governs: business.
requestor requests: improvements in: activity.
expector expects: improvements in: activity for: business.
developer designs: component, dialog, interface.
developer builds: component, dialog, interface.
developer tests: component, dialog, interface.

```

The **syntopica** ModelSite can convert statements of this kind into a conceptual model web site, 
using either HTML or Markdown (GitHub) pages, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for model diagrams.
You can see an example of the pages and images generated by this tool in the companion project:
[A Conceptual Model for Software Requirements][sw-requirements].
There's another example in the repository for the [ECO Depot][eco-depot].


Project Vision
==============

The overall purpose of this project will be to push the envelope of object-oriented software design, using concepts from 
[EDUCE][educe-overview] to drive discovery and design.
This approach to requirements elicitation and capture can serve as an adjunct to [Domain-Driven Design DDD][fowler-ddd]. 
So, the tool can help automate some of those efforts, maintaining coordination between the concepts within an 
[ubiquitous language][ubiquitous-language] and the code, ideally connecting the two through web hosted, hyper-linked
resources (concepts and code).

The generated [example results][sw-requirements] intend to show what can be accomplished with **syntopica** 
and the [EDUCE][educe] process.
Because EDUCE is a process of incremental discovery and capture of facts, it warrants automation support, 
so that the captured facts, the related conceptual models, and attendant web pages and diagrams can all be maintained 
in synchrony with little manual effort.


Project Goals
=============

The current project goals include forging a critical mass of features in the library.
* generate web pages from model concepts and related discussions
* generate svg diagrams from model concepts, esp. facts
* address simplest diagram layout problems: 1 fact, 2 facts, 3 facts (per topic)

Eventual Goals
* provide assistance to convert discussions into formal models (NLP)
* generate code skeletons from conceptual models, e.g., with StringTemplate, or FreeMarker
* develop similarity measures for conceptual models, esp. fact comparison, predicate completion, ...
* develop semantic search functions
