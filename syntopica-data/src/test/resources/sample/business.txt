A business tends (or intends) to create value for its shareholders 
(if for-profit) and its constituents (those otherwise served or interested), 
whether or not the business is conducted for profit.

Value creation results from changes to (and improvements in the quality of) the world as effects. 
Sometimes, the value of the changes results in monetary exchanges, 
esp. when someone pays for the benefits received. 
Sometimes, the value is intrinsic to the changes themselves.
