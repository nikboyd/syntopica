### Discussion

There are potentially several kinds of [requestors](requestor.md).
A [requestor](requestor.md) generally oversees and requests [improvements](improvement.md) in some [business](business.md) [activity](activity.md)(s),
or they may have specific domain knowledge and expertise.
They also ensure that the conduct of [business](business.md) [activities](activity.md) remain in alignment with the purposes of the [business](business.md),
esp. with its [mission](mission.md) and [vision](vision.md).
